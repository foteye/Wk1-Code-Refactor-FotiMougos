Homework Week 1 - Code Refactor<br>
Author: Foti Mougos

### Brief:
The customer Horiseon has not requested that we perform any changes to the content or styling of their website. They have requested that we improve the readability & maintainability of the code in their website. They have also requested that we ensure all links and images display correctly.

### Lessons Learned:
Theres alot you can achieve with CSS that I thought was only possible/easy with jQuery libraries or bootstrap classes. HTML and CSS are reasonably forgiving if you have syntax errors. You can write elegant HTML without needing comments.

### //TODO:
#### CSS
[X] Tidy up CSS & fix bugs - lots of CSS to consolidate, quotes missing etc<br>
[X] Find out if * is valid CSS selector - yup universal selector<br>
[X] Site behaves badly in mobile resolution - solved via display: table; css and display: flex for the header.
[X] CSS file has sensible spacing & formatting

#### HTML
[X] Basic title - make it more descriptive/sensible<br>
[X] Empty .hero div? Is it needed? - yup its the big picture<br>
[X] Alt attributes should work - tested by borking the src on the images<br>
[X] SEO anchor not working - missing ID on the section<br>
[X] HTML file has sensible spacing & formatting

#### Customer Objectives
[X] Change Divs to more 'semantic' elements i.e section, header etc<br>
[X] Assess 'logical' structure of HTML - heading sizes cascade, i.e. we don't have H1's inside of divs with headings of H2 type
