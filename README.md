Homework Week 1 - Code Refactor<br>
Author: Foti Mougos

### Brief:
The customer Horiseon has not requested that we perform any changes to the content or styling of their website. They have requested that we improve the readability & maintainability of the code in their website. They have also requested that we ensure all links and images display correctly.

### //TODO:
#### CSS
[X] Tidy up CSS & fix bugs - lots of CSS to consolidate, quotes missing etc<br>
[X] Find out if * is valid CSS selector - yup universal selector<br>
<br>
[ KNOWN GAP ] Site behaves badly in mobile resolution - maybe need some bootstrap

#### HTML
[X] Crap title - make it more descriptive<br>
[X] Empty .hero div? Is it needed? - yup its the big picture<br>
[X] ] Alt attributes should work - tested by borking the src on the images<br>
[ ] Heading attributes in 'sequential' order
[X] SEO anchor not working - missing ID

#### Customer Objectives
[X] Change Divs to more 'semantic' elements i.e section, header etc<br>
[ ] Assess 'logical' structure of HTML
